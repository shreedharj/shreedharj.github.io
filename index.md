## About Me

Shreedhar Jangam is an undergraduate student advised by [Prof. Leilani Gilpin](https://people.ucsc.edu/~lgilpin/) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. His current research at the [AEIA Lab](https://aiea-lab.github.io/) focuses on the applications of generative and explainable systems, such as Large Language Models and their trustworthiness in various domains. Outside of research, Shreedhar enjoys backpacking, and practicing his wilderness EMT skills.

## Research Interests

- **XAI (Explainable AI):** Understanding how AI works, making AI more transparent, and making sure AI can be trusted.
- **LLMs (Large Language Models):** Ensuring that the model's responses are explainable, make sense and are reliable.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Exploring new approaches to RL. Currently learning applications and interpretability methods of Decision Transformers.
- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Currently on hold.
