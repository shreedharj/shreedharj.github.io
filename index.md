## About Me

Hi 👋🏼 I completed my B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Statistics at UC Santa Cruz, Baskin Engineering. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Leilani Gilpin](https://people.ucsc.edu/~lgilpin/) at the [AEIA Lab](https://aiea-lab.github.io/), where my work focused on LLM trustworthiness and failure modes, and by [Prof. Xin (Eric) Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/) at the [ERIC Lab](http://eric-lab.soe.ucsc.edu/people), where I studied reasoning LLMs and VLA safety evaluation. I am currently at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory working on physics-informed ML, sparse system identification, and discrepancy modeling for nonlinear dynamical systems. Outside of research, I enjoy backpacking and practicing my wilderness EMT skills.

## Research Interests

I’m excited by how embodied systems can reason about the world, learn interpretable dynamics, and act safely under uncertainty. This interest is motivated by questions of how language-based reasoning can be grounded in physical systems, and how structured dynamics can support reliable decision making. Broadly, my interets are in interpretable autonomy, grounded world models, and VLA-based reasoning monitors that help robots maintain reliable internal beliefs and execute robust manipulation behaviors.
