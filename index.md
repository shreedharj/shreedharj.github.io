## About Me

Hi üëãüèº I'm an undergraduate student advised by [Prof. Leilani Gilpin](https://people.ucsc.edu/~lgilpin/) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. My current research at the [AEIA Lab](https://aiea-lab.github.io/) focuses on the ***applications of generative and explainable systems***, such as Large Language Models and their trustworthiness in various domains. Beyond the lab, I‚Äôm exploring **Explainable Robotics and Autonomous Systems**, with a focus on integrating transparency and interpretability into robotics applications like human-centered autonomous systems and multi-agent collaboration. Outside of research, I enjoy backpacking and practicing my wilderness EMT skills.

## Research Interests

- **XAI (Explainable AI):** Investigating methods to make AI systems more transparent, trustworthy, and interpretable, particularly in safety-critical applications.
- **LLMs (Large Language Models):** Studying model architectures. Ensuring that the model's responses are explainable.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Developing and understanding RL algorithms. Learning applications for interpretability methods with Decision Transformers.
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Studying swarm robotics and distributed systems, focusing on optimizing communication, coordination, and transparency in autonomous groups.
